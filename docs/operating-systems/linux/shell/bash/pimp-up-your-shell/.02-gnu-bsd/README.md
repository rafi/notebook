## GNU vs. BSD

POSIX is a set of standards to implement.

GNU tools are basically open versions of tools that already existed but were
redone to conform to principals of open software.

Unix and BSD are "older" implementations of POSIX that are various levels of
"closed source".

## GNU vs. BSD

Let's install some GNU tools!

```bash
brew install coreutils gnutls gawk gnu-sed gnu-tar gnu-which
```

```bash
brew ls coreutils
/usr/local/bin/gsort --help
/usr/bin/sort --help
```

Note the difference.
