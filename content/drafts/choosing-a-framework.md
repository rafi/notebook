# Choosing a Python Web Framework

When it comes to Python, developers don't have much to think about choosing
a web framework: Django, the go-to framework with batteries included, or Flask,
a slim approach.

If you're thinking about writing a back-end API, you should consider
some newer frameworks built with speed in mind, and pack less utilities such
as templating and view rendering.
